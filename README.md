## Introduction

Welcome to **WebAuth101**, a comprehensive guide and practical project for understanding and implementing web authentication using SimpleWebAuthn. This project aims to provide a solid foundation in web authentication methods, protocols, and best practices.

## About SimpleWebAuthn

**SimpleWebAuthn** is a library designed to simplify the implementation of WebAuthn, the web standard for passwordless authentication using public-key cryptography. It provides both client-side and server-side utilities to facilitate the registration and authentication processes.

- **Client-Side**: Handles the interaction with the WebAuthn API in the browser.
- **Server-Side**: Provides utilities for validating the data received from the client, ensuring secure and compliant implementations.

SimpleWebAuthn makes it easy to integrate secure, passwordless authentication into your web applications with minimal effort.

## Prerequisites

To get started with this project, you'll need:

- A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A server-side setup to handle authentication requests (e.g., using Express.js).

## Main Technologies Used

**Client-Side**:

- **HTML**: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page and its content.
- **CSS**: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling HTML documents. It allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of your web pages.
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is a programming language that enables dynamic behavior on web pages. It allows you to create interactive elements and handle events such as form submissions.

**Server-Side**:

- **Node.js**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side, enabling you to build scalable and efficient web applications.
- **Express.js**: Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web applications. It simplifies the process of creating server-side logic and handling HTTP requests.

**Authentication**:

- **SimpleWebAuthn**: SimpleWebAuthn is a library that simplifies the implementation of WebAuthn, the modern standard for passwordless authentication. It provides both client-side and server-side utilities to handle the registration and authentication processes securely.
